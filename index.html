    <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>Hello, I am Alexa – the person, not the virtual assistant. At the beginning of my first semester, I thought that I wanted to work in the field of computers, and I started on a path to a career in computer programming. But I recently found that my passion lies in biology. I took two biology courses, and I found myself excited about the material and wanting to talk about it all the time. When I was sitting at Friendly’s telling my dad about cellular respiration, I realized that I am genuinely interested in biology. I also really connected with one of my professors, who I found out is the head of the Biotechnology department, so I decided to switch to that field. </p>
      
      <p>Because I started out majoring in Computer Information Systems, I will have some knowledge about computers and coding. Most people know that hard work is required for working and life in general, but I am hard-working because it’s built into my personality. This applies not only to professional situations but also to my hobbies, including traditional Greek dancing and exercising. Other things that I like are reading, animals, the beach, and spending time with my friends and family.</p>
